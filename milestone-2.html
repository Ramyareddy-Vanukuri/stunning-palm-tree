        <h1>Roads</h1>
        <p>The roads in india are in different types of conditions.the highways are some what better than the local roads.
            there is a lot of difference between roads in rural areas and urban areas. </p>
           <u> <h2>Urban area</h4></u>
            <p>In urban areas main roads are some what better but the roads in local are in very dirty manner because 
                in that route only local people will travel.so many accidents are happening due to the holes in roads.
            but no one repair them. </p>
